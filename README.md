### 3 types of tests:
    # function test
    # class based test


    2 main conviction:
    <function_name>_test # the most convenient
    test_<function_name> # not preferred


Pytest hide input and expected output by default --> use -s as argument

Pytest runs unittest TestLegacy as well

Tests are either in tree ( like this /tests), or out tree
